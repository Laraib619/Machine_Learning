## What is feature selection?
Feature selection is nothing more than selecting the best and most appropriate features for machine learning models, as well as deleting irrelevant or partially relevant characteristics from the data.
## Importance of feature selection.
1.	It reduces the curse of dimensionality..
2.	It minimizes the cost of computation 
3.	It aids in the understanding and application of the model.
4.	It aids in the achievement of positive outcomes.
### Feature selection techniques are of two types.
1.	Supervised feature selection 
2.	Unsupervised feature selection
#### Supervised feature selection are of three types.
1.	Filter method 
2.	Wrapper method
3.	Embedded method
#### Advantages of feature selection:
##### Filter Method 
1.	Better computational complexity 
2.	Independent of Classifier
3.	Fast and Scalable
##### Wrapper Method
1.	Interacts with the classifier 
2.	Model is feature dependent
3.	Minimizes computation cost
