## What is feature selection?
Feature selection is nothing but optimal and best feture for machine learning models. and also  removing irrelevant or partially relevant features from the data.
## Importance of feature selection.
1.	It reduces the curse of dimensionality..
2.	It minimizes the cost of computation 
3.	It helps in interpreting and learning the model
4.	It helps in achieving good results.
### Feature selection techniques are of two types.
1.	Supervised feature selection 
2.	Unsupervised feature selection
#### Supervised feature selection are of three types.
1.	Filter method 
2.	Wrapper method
3.	Embedded method
#### Advantages of feature selection:
##### Filter Method 
1.	Better computational complexity 
2.	Independent of Classifier
3.	Fast and Scalable
##### Wrapper Method
1.	Interacts with the classifier 
2.	Model is feature dependent
3.	Minimizes computation cost
